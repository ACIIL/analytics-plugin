<a name="what-is-kundi-bora" class="anchor" href="#what-is-kundi-bora"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Kundi Bora?</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tVdLw96.png" alt="Kundi Bora"></p>

<p>Kundi Bora is an analyitcs plugin for the Ushahidi platform (v 2.7.2). It takes the data from an existing Ushahidi install and provides the ability to build charts on the fly. It is a plugin, so installation is as easy as dropping the analytics folder into the plugins directory of an existing Ushahidi install. </p>

<h3>
<a name="ushahidi" class="anchor" href="#ushahidi"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ushahidi?</h3>

<p>Ushahidi is an open source software project that first debut during the 2008 kenyan elections in which it was used to track unrest that hit the nation during this time. The public would send in reports of violence or vote tampering and they would be displayed onto a map of the region. Incidents that occurred close together were clustered more or less depending on the level of detail in the map.</p>

<p>Since its debut, Ushahidi has continued to grow. As a platform for crowd sourcing information on a specific event or situation, it has been used to track unrest for other elections but also for more benign issues such as the incidence of potholes in a city.</p>

<a name="ok-but-why-do-i-need-analytics" class="anchor" href="#ok-but-why-do-i-need-analytics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OK, But Why Do I Need Analytics?</h3>

<p>You might not. If all your interested in is how many incidents there are in your city or country, then analytics probably won't do much for you. However, if you need to tease out trends from a data set then Kundi Bora is here to help. </p>

<h3>
<a name="charts-you-say-what-kind-of-charts" class="anchor" href="#charts-you-say-what-kind-of-charts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Charts, you say? What kind of charts?</h3>

<p>As it stands now, Kundi Bora serves up charts primarily with the <a href="http://www.flotcharts.org/">flotcharts</a> javascript library and includes a proof of concept for integrating the <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> javascript visualization library into the plugin. This proof of concept is meant to open up the door a myriad of data visualization options. </p>

<h3>
<a name="why-cant-i-just-install-these-libraries-myself" class="anchor" href="#why-cant-i-just-install-these-libraries-myself"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Can't I just install these libraries myself?</h3>

<p>You can! However, unless your comfortable querying the database, rolling the data you get into a JSON object that the libraries can use then writing the code that will actually use that data to create the different chart type, then I would stick to Kundi Bora. Lots of work has gone into not only creating the charts you see when you install the plugin but also writing the code that allows making more charts much easier for the uninitiated. This includes functions that allow you to get the data you want without having to know any SQL commands. It also includes code that simplifies working with the libraries by removing the need to write the chart code yourself. Simply call a chart function with the data you want and the chart is yours. If you don't want to touch any code, we've included filtering with a pie or line chart that allows you to select how the data (you can filter by category, country, date, and keyword) is displayed. We are working to bring this feature to all chart types in future releases. </p>

<p>The bottom line is, if you need analytics now for you deployment and don't have time to learn the nitty gritty of the Kohana platform Ushahidi uses or how to write the code that will produce the charts then take advantage of the work we've done. Why reinvent the wheel when someone is offering you one for free?</p>

<a name="d3i-love-d3" class="anchor" href="#d3i-love-d3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>D3?!I love D3!</h3>

<p>If you don't already love D3, Id suggest checking out their website. We'll wait. Back? Pretty neat, eh?
Our goal at the start of this project was to take the path of least resistance towards getting analytics working so we went with flot charts. We felt that the API for flotcharts was more forgiving to green horns. D3 was jsut too tempting though so we added a proof of concept showing that 1) out plugin can work with multiple visualization libraries and 2) what D3 can be used to show. </p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/LN7vzGE.png" alt="Parallel Coords"></p>

<p>We chose to use the Parallel coordinates view which is for sensing volumes of sets by visualizing the data. By narrowing down the dimensions, one can get a sense of how many incidents are for what Ushahidi category, location, and time, etc, just by looking at the volume returned.  What is here is not perfect and can use many edits, such as showing what percent of the data is selected in a column. <a href="http://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/">This</a> tool set was used to customize the parallel coordinates visualization you see in our plugin. </p>
